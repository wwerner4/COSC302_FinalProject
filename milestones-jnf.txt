+10 A C++ program that allows users to play a multiplayer game of poker/ other casino games on the command line (just the simple game functionality)
    +2 - a way to store the cards (data structure that is clearly visible)
        - a proper game deck exists and is accessible 
        - 4-7 players can join a table
    +2 - a player/user class
        - the player's hand is stored and is readable/accessible
        - the player's overall current type of hand (for example, royale flush, three of a kind, four of a kind, etc.)
    +6 - a game function that speeds up or slows down the AIs playing speed (for convenience to the user)
+15 AI Opponents
    - includes basically framework for intermediate level AI
        +5 - a system for the AI to determine the value of its hand probabilistically
        +8 - a system that plays on its turn 
        +2 - a system which its framework isn't extremely predictable 
+15 Graphical Interface
    +2  - Card rendering prototype
    +13 - Developed a proper, aesthetic Unity graphical interface which works as expected for a traditional poker game. All buttons, bets, folds, etc
        work as anticipated and the game does not crash.
            - This is a main point of discussion, as this part of the project could slightly change over time.
