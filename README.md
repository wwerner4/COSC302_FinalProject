To use the makefile/run cardDeckTest, you must have SFML 2.5.1 installed on your machine.

To install SFML 2.5.1 on linux/WSL, run the following command:
`sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev=2.5.1` (or maybe just `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`)

To compile a program that uses the SFML library, project object files must be linked with SFML library files. See Makefile for an example.
