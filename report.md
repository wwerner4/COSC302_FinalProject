1. Special libraries needed to build/compile if personal machines were used
    The graphics for our game were developed with the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML V2.5.1) in C++. This library must be installed on the system used to compile our program. To install SFML V2.5.1 on a Linux machine, run the following command in the terminal: `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev=2.5.1`. We were not able to run our project on the Hydra/Tesla machines because we do not have to capability to install SFML on those machines.
2. Instructions on how to build/compile your program
    Once SFML is installed, the program can be compiled using the included Makefile: `make all`. The executable for the program is playGame: `./playGame`.
3. User manual with how the controls/interactions work
    After launching the game, a GUI window should open on your machine. This window contains all the necessary mechanisms for a user to interact with the game. Clicking the 'X' button in the top right corner of the window will close the GUI and kill the program. To play the game, first click the "Play Game" button to enter the main game scene. At this point, the game loop will begin. When it is your turn to bet/fold, select the amount that you want to bet with the bet increment/decrement buttons. These are the two buttons with white triangles/arrows. To bet, press the check/call/raise button. If you want to fold, press the fold button. A betting round continues until all players have either bet the same amount or folded. Then, more cards are placed on the table, or the game ends (depending on the current stage of the game). When a hand ends, the cpu players' cards will be revealed and the winner will be determined. The win message is displayed for 10 seconds, then a new hand automatically starts (you won't be able to close the game during this 10-second period, as the program sleeps at this time). New hands will continue to be dealt indefinitely, until all but one player is out of chips or the user closes the game window.
4. Known bugs. If you document what you know is wrong, and these are minor issues, we will not take off for them. Examples include weird behavior, image mismatches, other last minute issues. If you document more serious issues (seg faults on conclusion, program crashing, etc.) we will give more partial credit.
    
5. Any other information that will inform the instructor and TAs for final grading. If there is special equipment, e.g., NES controllers or a special library, weâ€™ll make an appointment for the demo during exam week
